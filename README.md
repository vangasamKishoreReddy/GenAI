To create the "Code Fixer" application using Streamlit and the OpenAI API for code review functionality, you can follow these steps:

Set up your Streamlit environment: Install Streamlit and any necessary dependencies.

Create a Streamlit app script: Write a Python script that imports Streamlit and defines the user interface elements, such as text input for the code and a button to trigger the code review.

Integrate the OpenAI API: Utilize the OpenAI API to analyze the submitted Python code, identify potential bugs or errors, and provide fixed code snippets.

Display results: Present the analysis results, including any identified bugs or errors, along with the fixed code snippets, to the user in a clear and intuitive manner

You'll need to replace "your_openai_api_key.txt" with the path to your OpenAI API key file and adjust the API calls according to the OpenAI API documentation.
